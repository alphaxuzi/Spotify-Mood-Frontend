My project uses the FruityApi in order to display the names and calorie counts of the selected fruits. 
In turn clicking a card also results in the rendering of a component that shows a picture of the selected fruit
as well as a fun fact. This application was meant to show my comfortability with React for building
applications, along with providing me with some problem solving challenges to achieve my desired result.
